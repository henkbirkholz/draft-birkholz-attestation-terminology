               Remote Attestation Procedures Architecture
                draft-birkholz-rats-architecture-latest

Abstract

   The Remote ATtestation procedureS (RATS) architecture facilitates
   interoperability of attestation mechanisms by defining a set of
   participant roles and interactions that reveal information affecting
   the trustworthiness attributes of an attester's computing
   environment.  By making trustworthiness attributes explicit, they can
   be evaluated dynamically and within an operational context where risk
   mitigation depends on having a more complete understanding of the
   possible vulnerabilities germane to the attester's environment.

1.  Introduction

   The long-standing Internet Threat Model [RFC3552] focuses on threats
   on the communication channel, as pioneered by Dolev and Yao
   [DOLEV-YAO] in 1983.  However, threats on the endpoint [RFC5209] and
   components [RFC4949] of transisted communication gear (i.e. hosts)
   are increasingly relevant for assessing the security properties of a
   communication relationship.  Beyond collecting and conveying
   information ("Claims") about an endpoint's (host's) security posture
   [RFC5209], remote attestation is intended to provide some believable
   claims ("Evidence") about their security characteristics.

1.1.  RATS in a nutshell

   RATS provide the basis to assess the trustworthiness of endpoints by
   other parties:

   o  In the remote attestation workflow, Claims are accompanied by a
      proof of their veracity in order to provide believable Evidence.

   o  In the corresponding attestation provisioning workflow, Claims are
      accompanied by a proof of their veracity in order to provide
      believable Endorsements or Known-Good-Values.

   In RATS specific content is provided:

   o  Evidence is provided by the Attester.

   o  Endorsements and corresponding Known-Good-Values are provided by
      the Endorser.

   o  Attestation Results are provided by the Verifier.

   Attestation Results are the output of RATS and are created by the
   appraisal of Evidence with the help of Endorsements and Known-Good-
   Values.  If appropriate Endorsements about the Attester are
   available, Known-Good-Values about the Attester are available, and if
   the Attester is capable of creating believable Evidence - then the
   Verifier is able to create Attestation Results that enable Relying
   Parties to establish a level of confidence in the trustworthiness of
   the Attester.

2.  Terminology

   Conveyance:  a mechanism for transferring Claims, Evidence,
      Endorsements, Known-Good-Values or Attestation Results.

   Entity:  a user, organization, device or computing environment.

   Principal:  a key that endorses the characteristics of an Entity

   Trustworthiness:  an assessment whether an end system will do what is
      believed it will do and nothing else.

   Computing Environment:  a computing context powerful enough to create
      Evidence.

   Attesting Computing Environment:  a computing context with the
      capability to monitor other Computing Environments and to create
      Evidence.

   Attested Computing Environment:  a computing context that is
      monitored by an Attesting Computing Environment.

2.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Conceptual Overview

   In network protocol exchanges, it is often the case that one entity
   (a Relying Party) requires an assessment of the trustworthiness of a
   remote entity (an Attester or specifc system components [RFC4949]
   thereof).  Remote ATtestation procedureS (RATS) enable Relying
   Parties to establish a level of confidence in the trustworthiness of
   remote system components through the creation of attestation evidence
   by remote system components and a processing chain of architectural
   constituents towards the relying party.

   The corresponding trustworthiness attributes processed may not be
   just a finite set of values.  Additionally, the system
   characteristics of remote components themselves have an impact on the
   veracity of trustworthiness attributes included in Evidence.
   Attester environments can vary widely ranging from those highly
   resistant to attacks to those having little or no resistance to
   attacks.  Configuration options, if set poorly, can result in a
   highly resistant environment being operationally less resistant.
   Computing Environments are often malleable being constructed from re-
   programmable hardware, firmware, software and updatable memory.  When
   a trustworthy environment changes, the question has to be asked
   whether the change transitioned the environment from a trustworthy
   state to an untrustworthy state.  The RATS architecture provides a
   framework for anticipating when a relevant change with respect to a
   trustworthiness attribute occurs, what changed and how relevant it
   is.  A remote attestation framework also creates a context for
   enabling an appropriate response by applications, system software and
   protocol endpoints when changes to trustworthiness attributes do
   occur.

3.1.  Computing Environments

   In the RATS context, a Claim is a specific trustworthiness attribute
   that pertains to a particular Computing Environment of an Attester.
   The set of possible Claims is expected to follow the possible
   computing environments that support attestation.  In other words,



Birkholz, et al.         Expires March 12, 2020                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft              RATS Arch & Terms             September 2019


   identical (i.e. same type, model, versions, components and
   composition) Attesting Computing Environments can create different
   Claim values that still compose valid Evidence due to different
   computing contexts.  Exemplary Claims include flight vectors or
   learned configuration.

   Likely, there are a set of Claims that is widely applicable across
   most, if not all environments.  Conversely, there are Claims that are
   unique to specific environments.  Consequently, the RATS architecture
   incorporates extensible mechanisms for representing Claims.

   Computing Environments can be complex structurally.  In general,
   every Attester consists of multiple components (e.g. memory, CPU,
   storage, networking, firmware, software).  Components are
   computational elements that can be linked and composed to form
   computational pipelines, arrays and networks (e.g. a BIOS, a
   bootloader, or a trusted execution environment).

   An Attester includes at least one Computing Environment that is able
   to create attestation Evidence (the Attesting Computing Environment)
   about other Computing Environments (the Attested Computing
   Environments).  Not every computational element of an Attester is
   expected to be a Computing Environment capable of remote attestation.
   Analogously, remote attestation capable Computing Environments may
   not be capable of attesting to (creating evidence about) every
   computational element that interacts with the Computing Environment.
   A Computing Environment with an attestation capability can only be
   endorsed by an external entity and cannot create believable evidence
   about itself by its own.

   A Computing Environment with the capability of remote attestation:

   o  is separate from other Attested Computing Environments (about
      which attestation evidence is created), and

   o  is enabling the role of an Attester in the RATS architecture.

   A Computing Environment with the capability of remote attestation and
   taking on the role of an Attester has the following duties in order
   to create Evidence:

   o  monitoring trustworthiness attributes of other Computing
      Environments,

   o  collecting trustworthiness attributes and create Claims about
      them,

   o  serialize Claims using interoperable representations,



Birkholz, et al.         Expires March 12, 2020                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft              RATS Arch & Terms             September 2019


   o  provide integrity protection for the sets of Claims, and

   o  add appropriate attestation provenance attributes about the sets
      of Claims.

3.2.  Trustworthiness

   The trustworthiness of remote attestation capabilities is also a
   consideration for the RATS architecture.  It should be possible to
   understand the trustworthiness properties of the remote attestation
   capability for any set of claims of an remote attestation flow via
   verification operations.  The RATS architecture anticipates recursive
   trustworthiness properties and the need for termination.  Ultimately,
   a portion of a computing environment's trustworthiness is established
   via non-automated means.  For example, design reviews, manufacturing
   process audits and physical security.  For this reason, trustworthy
   RATS depend on trustworthy manufacturing and supply chain practices.

3.3.  RATS Workflow

   The basic function of RATS is creation, conveyance and appraisal of
   attestation evidence.  An Attester creates attestation Evidence
   (signed claims) that are conveyed to a Verifier for appraisal.  The
   appraisals compare Evidence with expected known good values called
   Assertions obtained from supply entities called Asserters.  There can
   be multiple forms of appraisal (e.g., software integrity
   verification, device composition and configuration verification,
   device identity and provenance verification).  Attestation Results
   are the output of appraisals that are signed and conveyed to Relying
   Parties.  Attestation Results provide the basis by which the Relying
   Party may determine a level of confidence to place in the application
   data or operations that follow.

   RATS architecture defines attestation Roles (i.e., Attester,
   Verifier, Asserter and Relying Party), the messages they exchange,
   their structure and the various legal ways in which roles may be
   hosted, combined and divided.  RATS messages are defined by an
   information model that defines claims, environment and protocol
   semantics.  Information model representations are realized as data
   structure and conveyance protocol binding specifications.

3.4.  Interoperability between RATS

   The RATS architecture anticipates use of information modeling
   techniques that describe computing environment structures - their
   components/computational elements and corresponding capabilties - so
   that verification operations may rely on the information model as an
   interoperable way to navigate the structural complexity.

4.  RATS Architecture

4.1.  Goals

   RATS architecture has the following goals:

   o  Enable semantic interoperability of attestation semantics through
      information models about computing environments and
      trustworthiness.

   o  Enable data structure interoperability related to claims, endpoint
      composition / structure, and end-to-end integrity and
      confidentiality protection mechanisms.

   o  enable programmatic assessment of trustworthiness.  (Note:
      Mechanisms that manage risk, justify a level of confidence, or
      determine a consequence of an attestation result are out of
      scope).

   o  Use-case driven architecture and design (RATS use cases are
      summarized in [I-D.richardson-rats-usecases]).

   o  Terminology conventions that are consistently applied across RATS
      specifications.

   o  Reinforce trusted computing principles that include attestation.

4.2.  Attestation Principles

   Specifications developed by the RATS working group apply the
   following principles:

   o  Freshness - replay of attested or asserted Claims about the
      Attesting Coputing Environment can be detected.

   o  Identity - the Attesting Computing Environment is identifiable
      (not ambiguous).

   o  Context - the Attesting Computing Environment has a well-defined
      boundary (not amorphous).

   o  Provenance - the origin of Claims with respect to the Attesting
      Computing Environment is known and correct.

   o  Duration - hints about the expected lifetime with respect to the
      volatility of Claim values as known by Attesting Computing
      Environment.

Internet-Draft              RATS Arch & Terms             September 2019


   o  Relevance - the Claims are associated with the Attesting Computing
      Environment.

   o  Veracity - the believability (level of confidence) of Evidence
      based on the endorsement of the Attesting Computing Environment
      and associated attesting system components by third parties.

4.3.  RATS Roles and Messages

   The RATS Roles (roles) are performed by RATS Actors.

   The RATS Architecture provides the building blocks to compose various
   RATS by leveraging existing and new protocols.  The goal is to enable
   semantic interoperability between different approaches and solutions
   via a unified terminology and by defining a common architectural
   model for RATS roles, actors, and the interactions between them.

   Figure Figure 1 provides an overview of the relationships between
   RATS Roles and the messages they exchange.

                           Figure 1: RATS Roles

4.3.1.  Roles

   Attester:  An Attestation Function that creates Evidence by
      collecting, formatting and protecting (e.g., signing) Claims.  It
      presents Evidence to other RATS Roles (e.g. a Verifier) using a
      conveyance mechanism or protocol.

Internet-Draft              RATS Arch & Terms             September 2019


   Verifier:  An Attestation Function that accepts Evidence from an
      Attester using a conveyance mechanism or protocol.  It also
      accepts Provable Assertions from an Asserter using a conveyance
      mechanism or protocol.  It verifies the protection mechanisms,
      parses and appraises Evidence according to good known-valid (or
      known-invalid) Claims.  It produces Attestation Results that are
      formatted and protected (e.g., signed).  It presents Attestation
      Results to other RATS Roles (e.g. a Relying Party) using a
      conveyance mechanism or protocol.

   Asserter:  An Attestation Function that generates Intrinsic Claims
      about an entity that implements the Attester.  It is assumed to be
      a trustworthy process.  The Asserter is presumed, by a Verifier,
      to produce valid Claims.  The process collects, formats and
      protects (e.g. signs) valid Claims known as Provable Assertions.
      It presents Provable Assertion to a Verifier using a conveyance
      mechanism or protocol.

   Relying Party:  An Attestation Function that accepts Attestation
      Results from other RATS Roles (e.g. a Verifier) using a conveyance
      mechanism or protocol.  It assesses Attestation Results protection
      mechanism, parses and appraises attestation result values
      according to an appraisal context (Note: definition of the
      appraisal context is out-of-scope).

4.3.2.  Role Messages

   Claims:  Statements about trustworthiness characteristics of an
      Attesting Computing Environment.

      The veracity of a Claim is determined by the reputation of the
      entity making the Claim.  (Note: Reputation may involve
      identifying, authenticating and tracking transactions associated
      with an entity.  Remote Attestation may be used to establish
      entity reputation, but not exclusively.  Other reputation
      mechanisms are out-of-scope).

   Evidence:  Claims that are formatted and protected by an Attester.

      Evidence SHOULD satisfy Verifier expectations for freshness,
      identity, context, provenance, duration, relevance and veracity.

   Known-Good-Values:  Claims about the Attester, the supply chain
      entity that implements the Attester and the processes that produce
      the Attester.  If an Attesting Computing Environment implements
      cryptography, they include Claims about key material.

Internet-Draft              RATS Arch & Terms             September 2019


      Like Claims, Known-Good-Values SHOULD satisfy a Verifier's
      expectations for freshness, identity, context, provenance,
      duration, relevance and veracity.  Known-Good-Values are reference
      Claims that are - like Evidence - well formatted and protected
      (e.g. signed).

   Endorsements:  Claims about the characteristics of an Attester's
      system components that are endorsed by external third parties,
      such as manufacturing entities or supply chain entities.

      Endorsements are intended to increase the level of confidence with
      respect to Evidence created by an Attester.

   Attestation Results:  Statements about the output of an appraisal of
      Evidence that are created, formatted and protected by a Verifier.

      Attestation Results provide the basis for a Relying Party to
      establsh a level of confidence in the trustworthiness of an
      Attester.  Attestation Results SHOULD satisfy Relying Party
      expectations for freshness, identity, context, provenance,
      duration, relevance and veracity.

4.4.  RATS Actors

   RATS Actors are entities, users, organizations, devices and computing
   environments (e.g., devices, platforms, services, peripherals).
   Actors can take on one or more RATS Roles.

   RATS Actors may implement one or more RATS Roles.  Role interactions
   occurring within the same RATS Actor are out-of-scope.

   The methods whereby RATS Actors may be identified, discovered,
   authenticated, connected and trusted, though important, are out-of-
   scope.

   Actor operations that apply resiliency, scaling, load balancing or
   replication are generally believed to be out-of-scope.

                   Figure 2: RATS Actor-Role Composition

   RATS Actors have the following properties: * Multiplicity - Multiple
   instances of RATS Actors that possess the same RATS Roles can exist.
   * Composition - RATS Actors possessing different RATS Roles can be
   combined into a singleton RATS Actor possessing the union of RATS
   Roles.  RATS Interactions between combined RATS Actors is
   uninteresting.  * Decomposition - A singleton RATS Actor possessing
   multiple RATS Roles can be divided into multiple RATS Actors.  RATS
   Interactions may occur between them.

5.  Security Considerations

   RATS Evidence, Verifiable Assertions and Results SHOULD use formats
   that support end-to-end integrity protection and MAY support end-to-
   end confidentiality protection.  Replay attack prevention MAY be
   supported if a Nonce Claim is included.  Nonce Claims often piggy-
   back other information and can convey attestation semantics that are
   of essence to RATS, e.g. the last four bytes of a challange nonce
   could be replaced by the IPv4 address-value of the Attester in its
   response.

   All other attacks involving RATS structures are not explicitly
   addressed by RATS architecture.  Additional security protections MAY
   be required of conveyance mechanisms.  For example, additional means
   of authentication, confidentiality, integrity, replay, denial of
   service and privacy protection of RATS payloads and actors may be
   needed.
