<p>Remote ATtestation ProcedureS (RATS) architecture facilitates the attestation of device characteristics that, in general, are based on specific trustworthiness qualities intrinsic to a device or service.

<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">In general, this document provides normative guidance how to use, create or adopt network protocols that facilitate remote attestation procedures.  The RATS Architecture anticipates broad deployment contexts that range from IoT to Cloud and Edge ecosystems.  The foundation of the RATS architecture is the specification of RATS Roles that can be chained via RATS Interactions and - as a result - may be composed into use-case specific Remote Attestation Procedures.  RATS Actors establish an ecosystem neutral context where RATS Roles are hosted and where a variety of Remote Attestation Procedure interactions are defined independent of specific conveyance protocols or message formats.  In summary, the goal of the RATS Architecture is to enable interoperable interaction between the RATS Roles. Hence, the RATS Architecture is designed to enable interoperability via well-defined semantics of the information model (attestation assertions/claims), associated with RATS Roles following a conveyance model (RATS Interactions) that may be used to compose domain-specific remote attestation solutions.</p>

<a href="#rfc.section.1.1">1.1.</a> <a href="#what-is-remote-attestation" id="what-is-remote-attestation">What is Remote Attestation</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.1">Unfortunately, the term Attestation itself is an overloaded term.  In consequence, the term Remote Attestation covers a spectrum of meanings.  The common denominator encompasses the creation, conveyance, and appraisal of evidence pertaining to the trustworthiness characteristics of the creator of the evidence.  In essence, RATS are used to enable the assessment of the trustworthiness of a communication partner.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.1">To consolidate the utilization of existing and emerging network protocols in the context of RATS, this document provides a detailed definition of Attestation Terminology that enables interoperability between different types pf RATS.  Specifically, this document illustrates and remediates the impedance mismatch of terms related to Remote Attestation Procedures used in different domains today.

Roles are  building blocks that can be providers and consumers of information.  In the RATS architecture, devices or services can take on RATS roles.

<dd style="margin-left: 8">Examples of Claimant assertions include: * The hardware, firmware and software components of the Attester.  * The manufactuer of Attester components.  * The Attester&#8217;s current configuration.  * The Attester&#8217;s current location - e.g. GPS coordinates.  * The method by which binding of an attester to an RTR.  * The identifier(s) available for identifying and authenticating the Attester - e.g. Universal Entity ID (UEID).</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">Typically, claimant role are taken on by RATS Actors that supply chain entities (SCE).

<dt>Attester:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">The producer of attestation evidence that has a root of trust for reporting (RTR) and implements a conveyance protocol, authenticates using an attestation credential, consumes assertions about itself and presents it to a consumer of evidence (e.g. a relying party or a verifier).

<dt>Authentication Checker:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">The consumer of signed assertions such as trusted claim sets or attestation evidence that assesses the trustworthiness or other trust relationships of the information consumed via trusted third parties or external trust authorities, such as a privacy certificate authority.  In certain environments, an Authentication Checker can assess a system&#8217;s trustworthiness via external trust anchors, implicitly.</dd>
<dt>Verifier:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">The consumer of attestation evidence that has a root of trust for verification (RTV), implements conveyance protocols, appraises attestation evidence against reference values or policies, and makes verification results available to relying parties.</dd>
<dt>Relying Party:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">The consumer and assessor of verifier or Authentication Checker results for the purpose of improved risk management, operational efficiency, security, privacy (natural or legal person) or safety.

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.5.p.1">The flow of information between RATS Roles located on RATS Actors compose individual remote attestation procedures.  The RATS Architecture provides a set of standard interactions between the RATS Roles defined in this document in order to enable this composability.  In this section, common interactions between roles are specified.  This list of interactions is not exhaustive, but provides the basis to create various standard RATS.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.5.p.2">Every RATS Interaction specified below is based on the information flow between two RATS Roles defined above.  Every RATS Interaction is conducted via an Interconnect between corresponding RATS Roles that RATS Actors take on.  If more than one RATS Role resides on the same RATS Actor, a network protocol might not be required.  If RATS Roles are collapsed into a singular RATS Actor in this way, the method of conveying information is out-of-scope of this document.  If network protocols are used to convey corresponding information between RATS Roles (collapsed on a singular RATS Actor or not), the definitions and requirements defined in this document apply.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.5.p.3">In essence, an Interconnect is an abstract &#8220;distance-less&#8221; channel between RATS Actors that can range from General Purpose Input Output (GPIO) interfaces to the Internet.</p>
<p></p>

<dl>
<dt>Attester/Verifier:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">The most basic RATS interaction is between the creator of evidence (Attester) and its complementary remote attestation service (Verifier). In order to convey evidence (or assertions that are not accompanied by a proof of their validity) this RATS Interaction is required.</dd>
<dt>Attester/Relying-Party:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">A Relying Party typically requires external help to either validate authentication information or to appraise evidence presented by an Attester. In most cases, a Relying Party requires a corresponding Verifier to process the assertions/evidence received. In consequence, (a subset of) the information received by an Attester must be relayed securely to a Verifier.</dd>
<dt>Relying-Party/Verifier:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">Typically, trusted assertions or evidence are conveyed from an Attester to a Relying Party. In an open ecosystem, such as the Internet, the appraisal of the evidence presented by an Attester provided in order to assess its trustworthiness requires a remote attestation service. Hence, either the RATS roles of Verifier and Relying Party are collapsed and compose a single RATS Actor, or - if they reside on separate RATS Actors - a Relying Party requires appropriate configuration or a discovery/join/rendezvous service to initiate a RATS Interaction with an appropriate and trusted Verifier.</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">Attestation information originating from an Attester that is relayed via a Relying Party must be protected from replay or relay attacks, accordingly. In a closed ecosystem, trustworthiness with respect to the Attester can be achieved via a simply query to the Verifier. In an open ecosystem, the information conveyed in this interaction can include integrity measurements of every distinguishable software component that has been executed since its last boot cycle.</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">In the scope of RATS, this interaction encompasses the largest variety of information conveyed.</dd>
<dt>Claimant/Verifier:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">The intended operational state an Attester is intended to be in, is defined by the supply chain entities that manufacture and maintain the Attestor. In order to appraise trusted assertions or evidence conveyed by the Attester, every distinguishable system component the Attester is composed of can provide trusted assertions or evidence about its trustworthiness. A corresponding verifier that is tasked with assessing the trustworthiness of the Attester potentially requires a multitude of sources of reference values according to policies and the information provided. As Relying Parties often have to discover an appropriate Verifier, a Verifier has to obtain and potentially store appropriate reference values in order to asses assertions or evidence about trustworthiness.</dd>
<dt>Claimant/Attester:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">To enable RATS, trustworthy assertions have to be embedded in an Attester by its manufactorer. In some cases this involves various types of roots of trust. In other cases shielded pre-master secrets in combination with key derivation functions (KDF) provide this binding of trusted information to an Attester. A supply chain entity can embed additional trusted assertions to an Attester. These assertion can also be used to assert the trustworthiness on behalf of a separate RATS Actor or they can originate from an external entity (e.g. a security certification authority).</dd>

<p id="rfc.section.5.p.1">Attester are typically composite devices (in the case of atomically integrated devices that would result in a composite device with one component) or services.  Services are software components - e.g. a daemon, a virtual network function (vnf) or a network security function (nsf) - that can reside on one or more Attester and are not necessarily bound to a specific set of hardware devices.</p>

<p><a href="#RFC4949" class="xref">[RFC4949]</a> provides definitions that highlight the difference between a &#8220;trusted system&#8221; and a &#8220;trustworthy system&#8221;.  The following definitions exclude the explicit specialization of concepts that are &#8220;environmental disruption&#8221; as well as &#8220;human user and operator errors&#8221;.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.2">A trusted system in the context of RATS &#8220;operates as expected, according to design and policy, doing what is required and not doing other things&#8221; <a href="#RFC4949" class="xref">[RFC4949]</a>.  A trustworthy system is a system &#8220;that not only is trusted, but also warrants that trust because the system&#8217;s behavior can be validated in some convincing way, such as through formal analysis or code review&#8221; <a href="#RFC4949" class="xref">[RFC4949]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.3">The goal of RATS is to convey information about system component characteristics, such as integrity or authenticity, that can be appraised in a convincing way.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.4">RATS require trust relationships with third parties that qualify assertions about, for example, origin of data, the manufacturer or the capabilities of a system, or the origination of attestation evidence (attestation provenance).  Without trusted authorities (e.g. a certificate authority) it is virtually impossible to assess the level of assurance (or resulting level of confidence, correspondingly) of information produced by RATS.  Trusting a system does not make it trustworthy.  Assessing trustworthiness requires the conveyance of evidence that a system is a trustworthy system, which has to originate from the system itself and has to be convincing.  If the convincing information is not originating from the system itself, it comprises trusted claim sets and not evidence.  In essence, the attestation provenance of attestation evidence is the system that intends to present its trustworthiness in a believable manner.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.5">The essential basis for trust in the information created via RATS are roots of trust.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.6">Roots of trust are defined by the NIST special publication 800-164 draft as &#8220;security primitives composed of hardware, firmware and/or software that provide a set of trusted, security-critical functions.  They must always behave in an expected manner because their misbehavior cannot be detected.  As such, RoTs need to be secured by their design. Hardware RoTs are preferred over software RoTs due to their immutability, smaller attack surface, and more reliable behavior.&#8221;</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.7">If the root of trust involved is a root of trust for measurement (RTM), the producer of information takes on the role of a asserter.  An asserter can also make use of a root of trust for integrity (RTI) in order to increase the level of assurance in the assertions produced.  If the root of trust involved is a root of trust for reporting (RTR), the producer of information takes on the role of an attester.</p>

A secret signing key is required for this procedure, which is typically stored in a shielded location that can be trusted, for example, via a root of trust for storage (RTS).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.2">The RATS attester role produces signed attestation evidence in order to convey information.

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.1">During its evolution, the term Remote Attestation has been used in multiple contexts and multiple scopes and in consequence accumulated various connotations with slightly different semantic meaning.  Correspondingly, Remote Attestation Procedures (RATS) are employed in various usage scenarios and different environments.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.2">In order to better understand and grasp the intent and meaning of specific RATS in the scope of the security area - including the requirements that are addressed by them - this document provides an overview of existing work, its background, and common terminology.  As the contribution, from that state-of-the-art a set of terms that provides a stable basis for future work on RATS in the IETF is derived.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.3">In essence, a prerequisite for providing an adequate set of terms and definitions for the RATS architecute is a general understanding and a common definitions of &#8220;what&#8221; RATS can accomplish &#8220;how&#8221; RATS can to be used.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.4">Please note that this section is still missing various references and is considered &#8220;under construction&#8221;. The majority of definitions is still only originating from IETF work. Future iterations will pull in more complementary definitions from other SDO (e.g. Global Platform, TCG, etc.) and a general structure template to highlight semantic relationships and capable of resolving potential discrepancies will be introduced. A section of context awareness will provide further insight on how Attestation procedures are vital to ongoing work in the IETF (e.g. I2NSF &amp; tokbind).  The definitions in the section about RATS are still self-describing in this version. Additional explanatory text will be added to provide more context and coherence.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.1">7.1.</a> <a href="#the-lying-endpoint-problem" id="the-lying-endpoint-problem">The Lying Endpoint Problem</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.1">A very prominent goal of RATS is to address the &#8220;lying endpoint problem&#8221;.  The lying endpoint problem is characterized as a condition of a Computing Context where the information or behavior embedded, created, relayed, stored, or emitted by the Computing Context is not &#8220;correct&#8221; according to expectations of the authorized system designers, operators and users.  There can be multiple reasons why these expectations are incorrect, either from malicious Activity, unanticipated conditions or accidental means.  The observed behavior, nevertheless, appears to be a compromised Computing Context.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.2">Attempts to &#8220;scrub&#8221; the data or &#8220;proxy&#8221; control elements implies the existence of a more fundamental trusted endpoint that is operating correctly.  Therefore, Remote Attestation - the technology designed to detect and mitigate the &#8220;lying endpoint problem&#8221; &#8211; must be trusted to behave correctly independent of other controls.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.3">Consequently, a &#8220;lying endpoint&#8221; cannot also be a &#8220;trusted system&#8221;.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.4">Remote Attestation procedures are intended to enable the consumer of information emitted by a Computing Context to assess the validity and integrity of the information transferred.  The approach is based, for example, on the assumption that if attestation evidence can be provided in order to prove the integrity of every software instance installed involved in the activity of creating the emitted information in question, the emitted information can be considered valid and integer.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.5">In contrast, such Evidence has to be impossible to create if the software instances used in a Computing Context are compromised.  Attestation activities that are intended to create this Evidence therefore also provide guarantees about the validity of the Evidence they can create.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.1.p.1">RATS imply the involvement of at least two players (roles) who seek to overcome the lying endpoint problem.  The Verifier wishes to consume application data supplied by a Computing Context.  But before application data is consumed, the Verifier obtains Attestation Evidence about the Computing Context to assess likelihood of poisoned data due to endpoint compromise or failure.  Remote Attestation argues that a systems&#8217;s integrity characteristics should not be believed until rationale for believability is presented to the relying party seeking to interact with the system.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.1.p.2">An Interconnect defines an untrusted channel between subject and object wherein the rationale for believability is securely exchanged. The type of interconnect technology could vary widely, ranging from GPIO pins, to a PC peripheral IO bus, to the Internet, to a direct physical connection, to a wireless radio-receiver association, or to a world wide mesh of peers. In other words, virtually every kind communication path could be used as the &#8220;Interconnect&#8221; in RATS. In fact, a single party could take on all roles at the same time (e.g. Self Encrypting Devices).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.1.p.3">Attestation evidence can be thought of as the topics of the exchange that is created the operational primitives of a root of trust for reporting.  Evidence may be structured in an interoperable format called claims that may include references to the claimants which are asserting the claims.  RATS aims to define &#8220;interoperable Remote Attestation&#8221; such that evidence can be created and consumed by different ecosystem systems and can be securely exchanged by a broad set of network protocols.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.8.1.p.1">This section introduces the term Computing Context in order to specialize the notions of environment and endpoint to terminology that has relevance to trusted computing. Attestation is a discipline of trusted computing.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.1.p.2">A Computing Context could refer to a large variety of endpoints. Examples include but are not limited to: the compartmentalization of physical resources, the separation of software instances with different dependencies in dedicated containers, and the nesting of virtual components via hardware-based and software-based solutions.  The number of approaches and techniques to construct an endpoint continuously changes with new innovation.  Hence, it isn&#8217;t a goal of this document to define remote attestation for a fixed set of endpoints.  Rather, it attempts to define endpoints conceptually and rely on Claims management as a way to clarify the details and specific attributes of conceptual endpoints.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.1.p.3">Computing Contexts may be recursive in nature in that it could be composed of a system that is itself a composite of subsystems.  In consequence, a system may be composed of other systems that may be further composed of one or more Computing Contexts capable of taking on the RATS roles.  The scope and application of these roles can range from:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Continuous mutual Attestation procedures of every subsystem inside a composite device, to</li>
<li>Sporadic Remote Attestation of unknown parties via heterogeneous Interconnects.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.8.1.p.5">Analogously, the increasing number of features and functions that constitute components of a device start to blur the lines that are required to categorize each solution and approach precisely.  To address this increasingly challenging categorization, the term Computing Context defines the characteristics of the (sub)systems that can take on the role of an Attester and/or the role of a Verifier.  This approach is intended to provide a stable basis of definitions for future solutions that continuous to remain viable long-term.</p>

<dt>Assurance:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">An attribute of an information system that provides grounds for having confidence that the system operates such that the system&#8217;s security policy is enforced <a href="#RFC4949" class="xref">[RFC4949]</a> (see Trusted System below).</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">In common criteria, assurance is the basis for the metric level of assurance, which represents the &#8220;confidence that a system&#8217;s principal security features are reliably implemented&#8221;.</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">The NIST Handbook [get ref from 4949] notes that the levels of assurance defined in Common Criteria represent &#8220;a degree of confidence, not a true measure of how secure the system actually is. This distinction is necessary because it is extremely difficult&#8211;and in many cases, virtually impossible&#8211;to know exactly how secure a system is.&#8221;</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">Historically, assurance was well-defined in the Orange Book [http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/history/dod85.pdf] as &#8220;guaranteeing or providing confidence that the security policy has been implemented correctly and that the protection-relevant elements of the system do, indeed, accurately mediate and enforce the intent of that policy.  By extension, assurance must include a guarantee that the trusted portion of the system works only as intended.&#8221;</dd>
<dt>Confidence:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">The definition of correctness integrity in <a href="#RFC4949" class="xref">[RFC4949]</a> notes that &#8220;source integrity refers to confidence in data values&#8221;.  Hence, confidence in an Attestation procedure is referring to the degree of trustworthiness of an Attestation Activity that produces Evidence (Attester), of an Conveyance Activity that transfers Evidence (interconnect), and of a Verification Activity that appraises Evidence (Verifier), in respect to correctness integrity.</dd>
<dt>Correctness:</dt>

<dd style="margin-left: 8">A vetting process that verifies the information used to establish the identity of a system entity.</dd>
<dt>(Information) System:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">An organized assembly of computing and communication resources and procedures &#8211; i.e., equipment and services, together with their supporting infrastructure, facilities, and personnel &#8211; that create, collect, record, process, store, transport, retrieve, display, disseminate, control, or dispose of information to accomplish a specified set of functions.</dd>
<dt>Object:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">A system component that contains or receives information.</dd>
<dt>Source Integrity:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">The property that data is trustworthy (i.e., worthy of reliance or trust), based on the trustworthiness of its sources and the trustworthiness of any procedures used for handling data in the system.</dd>

<dd style="margin-left: 8">An identifiable and self-contained part of a $Target-of-Evaluation.</dd>
<dt>Token:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">A data structure suitable for containing Claims.</dd>
