  <h1 id="rfc.section.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> <a href="#introduction" id="introduction">Introduction</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">Over the years, the term attestation has been used in multiple contexts and multiple scopes and therefore accumulated various connotations with slightly different semantic meaning.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">In order to better understand and grasp the intend and meaning of specific attestation procedures in the security area - including the requirements that are addressed by them - this document provides an overview of existing work, its background, and common terminology. As the contribution, from that state-of-the-art a set of terms that provides a stable basis for future work on attestation procedures in the IETF is derived.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">The primary application of attestation procedures is to increase the trust and confidence in the integrity of the characteristics and properties of a system entity that intends to provide data to other system entities remotely. Hence, the most common application of attestation is Remote Attestation (RAT) and - in consequence - will be the most prominent topic of this reference terminology.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">How a system entity&#8217;s characteristics are attested and which characteristics are actually chosen to be attested varies with the requirements of the use cases, or-&#8211;in essence&#8211;-depends on the risk that is intended to be mitigated via an attestation procedure. It is important to note that the activity of attestation itself in principle only provides the evidence that proves integrity as a basis for further activities. The resulting attestation procedure defines the greater semantic context about how the evidence is used and what an attestation procedures actually accomplishes; and what it cannot accomplish, correspondingly. Hence, this document is also intended to provide a map of terms, concepts and applications that illustrate the ecosystem of current applications of attestation procedures.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.5">Illustrating the context and the semantics of attestation procedures in this document requires to include the domains of trust, trusted systems and the composite of trusted software running on trusted hardware (a trusted computing context). A prominent example is Secure Boot; a procedure that composes a continuous chain of attestation activities that start with powering up a system entity and ultimately extend into user-space characteristics after boot-up in order to provide evidence that the composite a computing context composes is a trusted system.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.6">Before an adequate set of terms and definitions for the domain of attestation procedures can be defined, a general understanding and the global definitions of the &#8220;what&#8221; and the &#8220;how&#8221; have to be established. In consequence, [enter final structure here].</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.7">Please note that the time before the I-D deadline did not suffice to fill in all the references.  Most references are therefore still under construction. The majority of definitions is still only originating from IETF work. Future iterations will pull in more complementary definitions from other SDO (e.g. Global Platform, TCG, etc.) and a general structure template to highlight semantic relationships and capable of resolving potential discrepancies will be introduced. A section of context awareness will provide further insight on how attestation procedures are vital to ongoing work in the IETF (e.g. I2NSF &amp; tokbind). The definitions in the section about Remote Attestation are basically self-describing in this version. Additional explanatory text will be added to provide more context and coherence.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.1">The use of the term remote attestation always implies the involvement of at least two parties that each take on a specific role in corresponding procedures &#8211; the attestee role and the verifier role.  Depending on the characteristics attested and the nature of the parties, information is exchanged via specific types of interconnects between them. The type of interconnect ranges from GIO pins, to a bus, to the Internet, or from a direct physical connection, to a wireless association, to a world wide mesh of peers. In other words, virtually every kind communication path can be used by the two roles. In fact, a single party can take on both roles at the same time, but there is only a limited use to this architecture.</p>
<p></p>

<dl>
<dt>Attestee:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">The role that designates the subject of the attestation. The provider of evidence.</dd>
<dt>Verfifier:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">The role that designates the appraiser of the attestee&#8217;s attestation. The consumer of evidence.</dd>
<dt>Interconnect:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">A channel of communication between attestee and verifier that enables the appraisal of evidence created by the attestee by a (remote) verifier.</dd>

<a href="#rfc.section.3">3.</a> <a href="#computing-context" id="computing-context">Computing Context</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.1">This section introduces the term computing context in order to simplify the definition of attestation terminology.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.2">The number of approaches and solutions to create things that provide the same capabilities as a &#8220;simple physical device&#8221; continuously increases. Examples include but are not limited to: the compartmentalization of physical resources, the separation of software instances with different dependencies in dedicated containers, and the nesting of virtual components via hardware-based and software-based solutions.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.3">In essence, every physical or logical system is a composite. Every component in that composite is a potential computing context capable of taking on the roles of attestee or verifier. The scope and application of these roles can range from continuous mutual attestation procedure, in which every component in a hierarchically structured composite that constitutes a single distinguishable endpoint on the management plane, to sporadic attestation of the integrity of an experiment in earth orbit.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.4">Analogously, the increasing number of features and functions start to blur the lines that are required to categorize each solution and approach precisely. To address that increasingly difficult categorization, the term computing context defines the characteristics of the entities that can take on the role of an attestee &#8211; and in consequence the role of a verifier. This approach is intended to provide a stable basis of definitions for future solutions that continuous to remain viable long-term.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Computing context :</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">An umbrella term that combines the scope of the definitions of endpoint [ref NEA], device [ref 1ar], and thing [ref t2trg], including hardware-based and software-based sub-contexts that constitute independent and distinguishable slices of a computing context created by compartmentalization mechanisms, such as trusted execution environments or virtual network security function contexts.</dd>

<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.1">The formal semantic relationship of a computing context and the definitions provided by RFC 4949 is a as follows.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.2">The scope of the term computing context encompasses:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>an information system,</li>
<li>an object and in consequence a system component or a composite of system sub-components, and</li>
<li>a system entity or a composite of system entities.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.4">Analogously, a sub-context is a subsystem and as with system components, computing contexts can be nested and therefore be physical system components or logical (&#8220;virtual&#8221;) system (sub-)components.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.5">The formal semantic relationship is based on the following definitions from RFC 4949.</p>
<p></p>

<dl>
<dt>(Information) System:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">An organized assembly of computing and communication resources and procedures &#8211; i.e., equipment and services, together with their supporting infrastructure, facilities, and personnel &#8211; that create, collect, record, process, store, transport, retrieve, display, disseminate, control, or dispose of information to accomplish a specified set of functions.</dd>
<dt>Object:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">A system component that contains or receives information.</dd>
<dt>Subsystem:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">A collection of related system components that together perform a system function or deliver a system service.</dd>

<ul>
<li>provides its own independent environment in regard to executing and running software,</li>
<li>may create its own separate control plane state (by potentially interacting with other computing contexts),</li>
<li>may be able to provide a dedicated management interface by which control plane behavior can be effected,</li>
<li>can be identified uniquely and therefore reliably differentiated in a given scope,</li>
<li>does not necessarily have to include a network interface with associated network addresses (as required, e.g. by the definition of an endpoint) &#8211; although it is likely to have (access to) one, and</li>
<li>is capable of taking on the role of an attestee or a verifier.</li>

<p id="rfc.section.4.p.2">In the context of attestation, the authenticity and corresponding proof of integrity in respect to an identity are typically based on a secret that is only available to the individual subjects that maintain or try to create a trust relationship, e.g. an attestee or certificate authority (CA). If a secret key, for example, is used to sign a public key such that the signed public key can be used as evidence, the shielding of the secrets involved is essential to the quality of confidence in the public key or the signature, and - in consequence - the evidence that constitutes the attested identity of the Computing Context.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.1">This section introduces terms and definitions that are required to illustrate the scope and the granularity of attestation workflows in the context of security automation. Terms defined in the following sections will be based on this workflow-related definitions.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.2">In general, attestation is an iterative procedure that is conducted over and over again in a computing context under specific conditions. It is neither a generic set of actions nor simply a task, because the actual actions to be undertaken in order to conduct an attestation procedure can vary significantly depending on the protocols employed and types of computing contexts involved.</p>
<p></p>

<dl>
<dt>Activity:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">The condition in which things are happening or being done. In the scope of attestation, an activity is a sequence of actions that is intended to produce a specifically defined result. The actual composition of actions can vary, depending on the characteristics of the computing context they are conducted by/in and the protocols used. A single activity provides only a minimal required amount of semantic context, e.g. by the activity&#8217;s requirements imposed on the computing context, or via set of actions it is composed of.  Example: The conveyance of cryptographic evidence or the acquisition of a trusted time stamp token are activities.</dd>
<dt>Task:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">A piece of work to be done or undertaken. In the scope of attestation, a task is an activity to be conducted.  Example: A Verifier can be tasked with the appraisal of evidence originating from a specific type of computing contexts.</dd>
<dt>Action:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">The accomplishment of a thing usually over a period of time, in stages, or with the possibility of repetition. In the scope of attestation, an action is the execution of an operation or function in the scope of an activity conducted by a single computing context. A single action provides no semantic context by itself, although it can limit potential semantic contexts of attestation procedures to a smaller subset.  Example: Signing an existing public key via a specific openssl library, transmitting data, or receiving data are actions.</dd>
<dt>Procedure:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">A series of actions that are done in a certain way or order. In the scope of attestation, a procedure is a composition of activities (sequences of actions) that is intended to create a well specified result with a well established semantic context.  Example: The activities of attestation, conveyance and verification compose a remote attestation procedure.</dd>

<dt></dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">The NIST Handbook [get ref from 4949] notes that the levels of assurance defined in Common Criteria represent &#8220;a degree of confidence, not a true measure of how secure the system actually is. This distinction is necessary because it is extremely difficult&#8211;and in many cases, virtually impossible&#8211;to know exactly how secure a system is.&#8221;</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">Historically, assurance was well-defined in the Orange Book [http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/history/dod85.pdf] as &#8220;guaranteeing or providing confidence that the security policy has been implemented correctly and that the protection-relevant elements of the system do, indeed, accurately mediate and enforce the intent of that policy.  By extension, assurance must include a guarantee that the trusted portion of the system works only as intended.&#8221;</dd>
<dt>Confidence:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">The definition of correctness integrity in <a href="#RFC4949" class="xref">[RFC4949]</a> notes that &#8220;source integrity refers to confidence in data values&#8221;.
