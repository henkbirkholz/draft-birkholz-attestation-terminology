<a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> <a href="#introduction" id="introduction">Introduction</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">During its evolution, the term Remote Attestation has been used in multiple contexts and multiple scopes and in consequence accumulated various connotations with slightly different semantic meaning.  Correspondingly, Remote Attestation Procedures (RATS) are employed in various usage scenarios and different environments.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">In order to better understand and grasp the intend and meaning of specific RATS in the scope of the security area - including the requirements that are addressed by them - this document provides an overview of existing work, its background, and common terminology. As the contribution, from that state-of-the-art a set of terms that provides a stable basis for future work on RATS in the IETF is derived.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">The primary application of RATS is to increase the trust and confidence in the integrity of the object characteristics and properties of a system entity that is intended to interact and exchange data with other system entities remotely. How an objects&#8217;s characteristics are attested remotely and which characteristics are actually chosen to be attested varies with the requirements of the use cases, or -&#8211; in essence &#8211;- depends on the risk that is intended to be mitigated via RATS.  Effectively, RATS are a vital tool to be used to increase the confidence in the level of trust of a system that is supposed to be a trusted system.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">In the remainder of this document a system that is capable to provide an appropriate amount of information about its integrity is considered to be a trustworthy system - or simply trustworthy.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.5">The primary characteristics of a trustworthy system are commonly based on information about the integrity of its intended composition, its enrolled and subsequently installed software components, and the scope of known valid states that a trustworthy system is supposed to operate in.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.6">It is important to note that the Activity of Attestation itself in principle only provides the Evidence that proves the integrity of a (subset) of a system&#8217;s object characteristics. The provided Evidence is used as a basis for further activities. Specific RATS define the higher semantic context about how the Evidence is utilized and what RATS actually can accomplish; and what they cannot accomplish, correspondingly. Hence, this document is also intended to provide a map of terms, concepts and applications that illustrate the ecosystem of current applications of RATS.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.7">In essence, a prerequisite for providing an adequate set of terms and definitions in the domain of RATS is a general understanding and a common definitions of &#8220;what&#8221; RATS can accomplish &#8220;how&#8221; RATS can to be used.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.8">Please note that this document is still missing multiple reference and is considered &#8220;under construction&#8221;. The majority of definitions is still only originating from IETF work. Future iterations will pull in more complementary definitions from other SDO (e.g. Global Platform, TCG, etc.) and a general structure template to highlight semantic relationships and capable of resolving potential discrepancies will be introduced. A section of context awareness will provide further insight on how Attestation procedures are vital to ongoing work in the IETF (e.g. I2NSF &amp; tokbind).  The definitions in the section about RATS are still self-describing in this version. Additional explanatory text will be added to provide more context and coherence.</p>

<a href="#rfc.section.2">2.</a> <a href="#the-lying-endpoint-problem" id="the-lying-endpoint-problem">The Lying Endpoint Problem</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.1">A very prominent goal of Remote Attestation is to address the &#8220;lying endpoint problem&#8221;. The lying endpoint problem is characterized as a condition of a Computing Context where the information or behavior embedded, created, relayed, stored, or emitted by the Computing Context is not &#8220;correct&#8221; according to expectations of the authorized system designers, operators and users. There can be multiple reasons why these expectations are incorrect, either from malicious Activity, unanticipated conditions or accidental means. The observed behavior, nevertheless appears to be a compromised Computing Context.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.2">Attempts to &#8220;scrub&#8221; the data or &#8220;proxy&#8221; control elements implies the existence of a more fundamental trusted endpoint that is operating correctly. Therefore, Attestation - the technology designed to detect and mitigate the &#8220;lying endpoint problem&#8221; &#8211; must be trusted to behave correctly independent of other controls.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.3">Consequently, a &#8220;lying endpoint&#8221; cannot also be a &#8220;trusted system&#8221;.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.4">Remote Attestation procedures are intended to enable the consumer of information emitted by an Computing Context to assess the validity and integrity of the information transferred. The approach is based on the assumption that if Evidence can be provided in order to prove the integrity of every software instance installed involved in the Activity of creating the emitted information in question, the emitted information can be considered valid and integer.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.5">In contrast, such Evidence has to be impossible to create if the software instances used in a Computing Context are compromised. Attestation activities that are intended to create this Evidence therefore also to also provide guarantees about the validity of the Evidence they can create.</p>

<a href="#rfc.section.3">3.</a> <a href="#what-are-remote-attestation-procedures-rats" id="what-are-remote-attestation-procedures-rats">What are Remote Attestation Procedures (RATS)?</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.1">Remote Attestation Procedures implies the involvement of at least two principles who seek to overcome the lying endpoint problem. The Verifier wishes to consume application data supplied by an a Computing Context. But before application data is consumed, the Verifier obtains Evidence about the Computing Context to assess likelihood of poisoned data due to endpoint compromise or failure. There is at least one principal known as the Claimant that asserts the Computing Context possesses certain integrity properties. A communication endpoint known as the Attestor conveys Evidence of Computing Context integrity properties to the Verifier as part of a protocol known as Remote Attestation.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.2">Attestation argues that an object&#8217;s integrity characteristics should not be believed until rationale for believability is presented to the subject seeking to interact with the object.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.3">An Interconnect defines an untrusted channel between subject and object wherein the rationale for believability is securely exchanged. The type of interconnect technology could vary widely, ranging from GPIO pins, to a PC peripheral IO bus, to the Internet, to a direct physical connection, to a wireless radio-receiver association, or to a world wide mesh of peers. In other words, virtually every kind communication path could be used as the &#8220;Interconnect&#8221; component of a Remote Attestation system. In fact, a single party can take on both roles at the same time.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.4">Attestation <em>Evidence</em> can be thought of as the topics of the exchange. Evidence may be structured in an interoperable format called Claims that may include references to Claimants who are the entities asserting the Claims.

<p id="rfc.section.4.p.1">This section introduces the term Computing Context in order to specialize the notions of environment and endpoint to terminology that has relevance to trusted computing. Attestation is a discipline of trusted computing.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.2">A Computing Context could refer to a large variety of endpoints. Examples include but are not limited to: the compartmentalization of physical resources, the separation of software instances with different dependencies in dedicated containers, and the nesting of virtual components via hardware-based and software-based solutions. The number of approaches and techniques to construct an endpoint continuously changes with new innovation. Hence, it isn&#8217;t a goal of this document to define remote attestation for a fixed set of endpoints. Rather, it attempts to define endpoints conceptually and rely on Claims management as a way to clarify the details and specific attributes of conceptual endpoints.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.3">Computing Contexts may be recursive in nature in that it could be composed of a system entity that is itself a composite of system entities. In consequence, a system entity may be composed of other system entities that may be further composed of one or more Computing Contexts capable of taking on the roles of Attestor, Verifier or Claimant. The scope and application of these roles can range from:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Continuous mutual Attestation procedures of every system entity inside a composite device, to</li>
<li>Sporadic Remote Attestation of unknown parties via heterogeneous Interconnects.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.5">Analogously, the increasing number of features and functions that constitute components of a device start to blur the lines that are required to categorize each solution and approach precisely. To address this increasingly challenging categorization, the term Computing Context defines the characteristics of the system entities that can take on the role of an Attestor and/or the role of a Verifier. This approach is intended to provide a stable basis of definitions for future solutions that continuous to remain viable long-term.</p>
