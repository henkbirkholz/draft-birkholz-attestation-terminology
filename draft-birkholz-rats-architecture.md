--- abstract

Remote ATtestation procedureS enable the assessment of the trustworthiness (RATS) of remote peers in various usage scenarios.
In order to support a resilient and vendor-interoperable solution ecosystem, the architecture module defined in this document enables a semantic mapping of existing remote attestation workflows, including solutions, such as Fast Identity Online (FIDO), Android Key Attestation (of the W3C Web Authentication), or Trusted Computing Group (TCG) Remote Integrity Verification (RIV).
The RATS architecture also provides a simple and unified basis to accommodate emerging solutions, such as the Device Identifier Composition Engine (DICE) or Time-based Uni-Directional Attestation (TUDA).
As a result, the RATS architectural model defined is composable, extensible & uses well-defined terminology.

# Introduction

Remote Attestation provides a way for an entity (the Relying Party) to determine the health and provenance of an endpoint (a host, or Attester).  Knowledge of the health of the entity, allows for a determination of trustworthiness of the endpoint.

## Motivation

The IETF has long spent it's time focusing on threats to the communication channel (see {{RFC3552}} and {{DOLEV-YAO}}), assuming that the end-points could be trusted, and were under the observation of a trusted, well-trained professional.
This assumption has not been true since the days of the campus mini-computer.
For some time after the desktop PC became ubiquitous the threat to the end-points has been dealt with as an internal matter, with generally poor results.
Enterprises have done some deployment of Network Endpoint Assessment ({{RFC5209}}) to assess the security posture about an endpoint (host), but it has not been ubiquitous.

The movement towards personal mobile devices ("smartphones") and the continuing threat from unmanaged residential desktops has resulted in a renewed interest in standardizing internet-scale end-point remote attestation.
Additionally, the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) has made this issue even more critical: some skeptics have even renamed it to the Internet of Threats {{iothreats}} :-)  IoT devices have poor or non-existant user interfaces, so there are not even good ways to assess the health of the devices manually: a need to determine the health via remote attestation is now critical.

In addition to the health of the device, knowledge of its provenance helps to determine the level of trust, and prevents attacks to the supply chain.

## Opportunities

The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is now a commonly available peripheral on many commodity compute platforms,  both servers and desktops.
Smartphones commonly have either an actual TPM, or have the ability to emulate one in software running in a trusted execution environment {{I-D.ietf-teep-architecture}}.  There are now few barriers to creating a standards-based system for remote attestation.

A number of niche solutions have emerged that provide for use-case specific remote attestation, but none have the generality needed to be used across the Internet.

##Â Overview of Document

The architecture described in this document (along with the accompanying protocol implementation documents) enables the use of a common format for communicating Claims about an Attester to a Relying Party.

Existing transports were not designed to carry attestation Claims.  It is therefore necessary to design serializations of Claims that fit into a variety of transports, for instance: X509 certificates, TLS negotiations, or EtherNet/IP.  There are also new, greenfield uses for remote attestation. Transport and serialization of these can be done without retrofitting. This is described in [TBD].

While it is not anticipated that the existing niche solutions described in the use cases section will exchange claims directly, the use of a common format enables common code.
As some of the code needs to be in intentionally hard to modify trusted modules, the use of a common format significantly reduces the cost of adoption to all parties.
This commonality also significantly reduces the incidence of critical bugs.

In some environments the collection of Evidence by the Attester to be provided to the Verifier is part of an existing protocol: this document does not change that, rather embraces those legacy mechanisms as part of the specification.  This is an evolutionary path forward, not revolutionary.
Yet in other greenfield environments, there is a desire to have a standard for Evidence as well as for Attestation Results, and this architecture outlines how that is done.

This introduction gives an overview of the protocol, interaction models, messaging models and roles involved.
Following this, is a terminology section that is referenced normatively by other documents and is a key part of this document.
There is then a section on use cases and how they leverage the roles and workflows described.

In this document, terminology which is defined within this document are consistency Capitalized.

Current verticals that use remote attestion include:
* The Trusted Computing Group "Network Device Attestation Workflow" {{I-D.fedorkow-rats-network-device-attestation}}
* Android Keystore {{keystore}}
* Fast Identity Online (FIDO) Alliance attestation {{fido}}
* A number of Intel SGX niche systems based upon OTRP.

## RATS in a Nutshell

* Attestation workflows typically convey Claims that contain the trustworthiness properties associated with an Attested Environment.
* A corresponding provisioning workflow conveys reference trustworthiness claims that can be compared with attestation Evidence. Reference values typically consist of firmware or software digests and details about what makes the attesting module trusted.
* Relying Parties are performing tasks such as managing a resource, controlling access, and/or managing risk. Attestation Results helps Relying Parties determine levels of trust.

## Attestation workflow

{:wholeflow: artwork-align="center"}
~~~~ WHOLEFLOW
{::include wholeflow.txt}
~~~~
{:wholeflow #wholeflow title="RATS Protocol Flows"}

In the RATS architecture shown above, specific content items are identified:

* Evidence is a provable Claim about a specific Computing Environment made by an Attester.
* Known-Good-Values are reference Claims used to appraise Evidence by the Verifier.
* Endorsements are reference Claims about the environment protecting the Attesters' capabilities to create believable Evidence (e.g. the type of protection for an attestation key). It answers the question "why Evidence is believable". [REWORD]
* Attestation Results are the output from the appraisal of Evidence, Known-Good-Values and Endorsements.

Attestation Results are the output of RATS.

Assessment of Attestation Results can be multi-faceted, but is out-of-scope for the RATS architecture.

If appropriate Endorsements about the Attester are available, Known-Good-Values about the Attester are available, and if the Attester is capable of creating believable Evidence -- then the Verifier is able to create Attestation Results that enable Relying Parties to establish a level of confidence in the trustworthiness of the Attester.

The Asserter role and the format for Known-Good-Values and Endorsements are not subject to standarization at this time.  The current verticals already includes provisions for encoding and/or distributing these objects already.

## Passport Model {#passport}

In the Passport Model protocol flow the Attester provides it's Evidence directly to the Verifier.  The Verifier will evaluate the Evidence and then sign a Claim.  This Claim is returned to the Attester, and it is up to the Attester to communicate the Claim to the Relying Party.

{:passportflow: artwork-align="center"}
~~~~ PASSPORT
{::include passport-workflow.txt}
~~~~
{:passwordflow #passport_diag title="RATS Passport Flow"}

This flow is named in this way because of the resemblance of how Nations issue Passports to their citizens. The nature of the Evidence that an individual needs to provide to it's local authority is specific to the country involved.  The citizen retains control of the resulting document and presents it to other entities when it
needs to assert a citizenship or identity claim.

## Background Check {#background}

In the Background Check Model protocol flow the Attester provides it's Evidence to the Relying Party.
The Relying Party sends this evidence to a Verifier of its choice.  The Verifier will evaluate the Evidence and then sign a Claim.  This Claim is returned to the Relying Party, which processes it directly.

{:passportflow: artwork-align="center"}
~~~~ BACKGROUND
{::include backgroundcheck-workflow.txt}
~~~~
{:passwordflow #background_diag title="RATS Background Check Flow"}

This flow is named in this way because of the resemblance of how employers and volunteer organizations
perform background checks.  When a prospective employee provides claims about education or previous experience, the employer will contact the respective institutions or former employers to validate the claim.  Volunteer organizations often perform police background checks on volunteers in order to determine the volunteer's trust-worthyness.

# Conceptual Overview

In network protocol exchanges, it is often the case that one entity (a Relying Party) requires an assessment of the trustworthiness of a remote entity (an Attester or specific system components {{RFC4949}} thereof).
Remote ATtestation procedureS (RATS) enable Relying Parties to establish a level of confidence in the trustworthiness of remote system components through the creation of attestation evidence by remote system components and a processing chain of architectural constituents towards the relying party.

The corresponding trustworthiness attributes processed may not be just a finite set of values. Additionally, the system characteristics of remote components themselves have an impact on the veracity of trustworthiness attributes included in Evidence.
Attester environments can vary widely ranging from those highly resistant to attacks to those having little or no resistance to attacks.
Configuration options, if set poorly, can result in a highly resistant environment being operationally less resistant.
Computing Environments are often malleable being constructed from re-programmable hardware, firmware, software and updatable memory.
When a trustworthy environment changes, the question has to be asked whether the change transitioned the environment from a trustworthy state to an untrustworthy state.
The RATS architecture provides a framework for anticipating when a relevant change with respect to a trustworthiness attribute occurs, what changed and how relevant it is.
A remote attestation framework also creates a context for enabling an appropriate response by applications, system software and protocol endpoints when changes to trustworthiness attributes do occur.

## Computing Environments

In the RATS context, a Claim is a specific trustworthiness attribute that pertains to a particular Computing Environment of an Attester.
The set of possible Claims is expected to follow the possible computing environments that support attestation.
In other words, identical (i.e. same type, model, versions, components and composition) Attesting Computing Environments can create different Claim values that still compose valid Evidence due to different computing contexts. Exemplary Claims include flight vectors or learned configuration.

Likely, there are a set of Claims that is widely applicable across most, if not all environments.
Conversely, there are Claims that are unique to specific environments.
Consequently, the RATS architecture incorporates extensible mechanisms for representing Claims.

Computing Environments can be complex structurally. In general, every Attester consists of multiple components (e.g. memory, CPU, storage, networking, firmware, software).
Components are computational elements that can be linked and composed to form computational pipelines, arrays and networks (e.g. a BIOS, a bootloader, or a trusted execution environment).

An Attester includes at least one Computing Environment that is able to create attestation Evidence (the Attesting Computing Environment) about other Computing Environments (the Attested Computing Environments).
Not every computational element of an Attester is expected to be a Computing Environment capable of remote attestation.
Analogously, remote attestation capable Computing Environments may not be capable of attesting to (creating evidence about) every computational element that interacts with the Computing Environment.
A Computing Environment with an attestation capability can only be endorsed by an external entity and cannot create believable evidence about itself by its own.

A Computing Environment with the capability of remote attestation:

* is separate from other Attested Computing Environments (about which attestation evidence is created), and
* is enabling the role of an Attester in the RATS architecture.

A Computing Environment with the capability of remote attestation and taking on the role of an Attester has the following duties in order to create Evidence:

* monitoring trustworthiness attributes of other Computing Environments,
* collecting trustworthiness attributes and create Claims about them,
* serialize Claims using interoperable representations,
* provide integrity protection for the sets of Claims, and
* add appropriate attestation provenance attributes about the sets of Claims.

## Trustworthiness

The trustworthiness of remote attestation capabilities is also a consideration for the RATS architecture.
It should be possible to understand the trustworthiness properties of the remote attestation capability for any set of claims of a remote attestation flow via verification operations.
The RATS architecture anticipates recursive trustworthiness properties and the need for termination.
Ultimately, a portion of a computing environment's trustworthiness is established via non-automated means.
For example, design reviews, manufacturing process audits and physical security.
For this reason, trustworthy RATS depend on trustworthy manufacturing and supply chain practices.

## RATS Workflow

The basic function of RATS is creation, conveyance and appraisal of attestation Evidence.
An Attester creates attestation Evidence that are conveyed to a Verifier for appraisal.
The appraisals compare Evidence with expected Known-Good-Values called obtained from Asserters (e.g. Principals that are Supply Chain Entities).
There can be multiple forms of appraisal (e.g., software integrity verification, device composition and configuration verification, device identity and provenance verification).
Attestation Results are the output of appraisals. Attestation Results are signed and conveyed to Relying Parties. Attestation Results provide the basis by which the Relying Party may determine a level of confidence to place in the application data or operations that follow.

RATS architecture defines attestation Roles (i.e., Attester, Verifier, Asserter and Relying Party), the messages they exchange, their structure and the various legal ways in which Roles may be hosted, combined and divided (see Principals below). RATS messages are defined by an information model that defines Claims, environment and protocol semantics. Information Model representations are realized as data structure and conveyance protocol binding specifications.

## Interoperability between RATS

The RATS architecture anticipates use of information modeling techniques that describe computing environment structures -- their components/computational elements and corresponding capabilities -- so that verification operations may rely on the information model as an interoperable way to navigate the structural complexity.

# RATS Architecture

## Goals

RATS architecture has the following goals:

* Enable semantic interoperability of attestation semantics through information models about computing environments and trustworthiness.
* Enable data structure interoperability related to claims, endpoint composition / structure, and end-to-end integrity and confidentiality protection mechanisms.
* Enable programmatic assessment of trustworthiness. (Note: Mechanisms that manage risk, justify a level of confidence, or determine a consequence of an attestation result are out of scope).
* Provide the building blocks, including Roles and Principals that enable the composition of service-chains/hierarchies and workflows that can create and appraise evidence about the trustworthiness of devices and services.
* Use-case driven architecture and design (RATS use cases are summarized in {{-rats-usecases}}).
* Terminology conventions that are consistently applied across RATS specifications.
* Reinforce trusted computing principles that include attestation.

## Attestation Principles

Specifications developed by the RATS working group apply the following principles:

* Freshness - replay of previously asserted Claims about an Attested Computing Environment can be detected.
* Identity - the Attesting Computing Environment is identifiable (non-anonymous).
* Context - the Attested Computing Environment is well-defined (unambiguous).
* Provenance - the origin of Claims with respect to the Attested and Attesting Computing Environments are known.
* Validity - the expected lifetime of Claims about an Attested Computing Environment is known.
* Relevance - the Claims associated with the Attested Computing Environment pertain to trustworthiness metrics.
* Veracity - the believability (level of confidence) of Claims is based on verifiable proofs.

## Attestation Workflow

Attestation workflow helps a Relying Party make better decisions by providing insight about the trustworthiness of endpoints participating in a distributed system. The workflow consists primarily of four roles; Relying Party, Verifier, Attester and Asserter. Attestation messages contain information useful for appraising the trustworthiness of an Attester endpoint and informing the Relying Party of the appraisal result.

<!--
The RATS Roles (roles) are performed by RATS Principals.

The RATS Architecture provides the building blocks to compose various RATS roles by leveraging existing and new protocols. It defines architecture for composing RATS roles with principals and models their interactions.
-->
This section details the primary roles of an attestation workflow and the messages they exchange.

### Roles {#roles}

An endpoint system (a.k.a., Entity) may implement one or more attestation Roles to accommodate a variety of possible interaction models. Exemplary interaction models are described in {{passport}} and {{background}}. Role messages are secured by the Entity that generated it. Entities possess credentials (e.g., cryptographic keys) that authenticate, integrity protect and optionally confidentiality protect attestation messages.

#### Attester {#attester}

The Attester consists of both an Attesting Environment and an Attested Environment. In some implementations these environments may be combined. Other implementations may have multiples of Attesting and Attested environments. Although endpoint environments can be complex, and that complexity is security relevant, the basic function of an Attester is to create Evidence that captures operational conditions affecting trustworthiness.

<!--
...by collecting, formatting and protecting (e.g., signing) Claims.
It presents Evidence to a Verifier using a conveyance mechanism or protocol.

The creator of Evidence. The Role that designates an Entity to be assessed with respect to its trustworthiness properties in the scope of a specific Profile.
-->

#### Asserter {#asserter}

The Asserter role
In reality there are likely to be many Entities that implement the Asserter and many instances of Reference Value messages.
<!--
An Attestation Function that generates reference Claims about both the Attesting Computing Environment and the Attested Computing Environment.
The manufacturing and development processes are presumed to be trustworthy processes.
In other words the Asserter is presumed, by a Verifier, to produce valid Claims.
The function collects, formats and protects (e.g. signs) valid Claims known as Endorsements and Known-Good-Values.
It presents provable Claims to a Verifier using a conveyance mechanism or protocol.
-->
<!--
An Asserter is the origin of Endorsements and Known-Good-Values. The Role that designates an Entity that facilitates attestation provision workflows and potentially provides trust anchors.
-->

#### Verifier {#verifier}

The Verifier workflow function accepts Evidence from an Attester and accepts Reference Values from one or more Asserters. Reference values may be supplied a'priori, cached or used to created policies. The Verifier performs an appraisal by matching Claims found in Evidence with Claims found in Reference Values and policies. If an attested Claim value differs from an expected Claim value, the Verifier flags this as a change possibly impacting trust level.

Endorsements may not have corresponding Claims in Evidence (because of their intrinsic nature). Consequently, the Verifier need only authenticate the endpoint and verify the Endorsements match the endpoint identity.

The result of appraisals and Endorsements, informed by owner policies, produces a new set of Claims that a Relying Party is suited to consume.
<!--
An Attestation Function that accepts Evidence from an Attester using a conveyance mechanism or protocol.
It also accepts Known-Good-Values and Endorsements from an Asserter using a conveyance mechanism or protocol.
It verifies the protection mechanisms, parses and appraises Evidence according to good-known valid (or known-invalid) Claims and Endorsements.
It produces Attestation Results that are formatted and protected (e.g., signed).
It presents Attestation Results to a Relying Party using a conveyance mechanism or protocol.
-->
<!--
The consumer of Evidence for appraisal. The Role that designates an Entity to create Attestation Results based on Evidence, Known-Good-Values, and Endorsements.
-->

#### Relying Party {#relyingparty}

A Role in an attestation workflow that accepts Results from a Verifier that may be used by the Relying Party to inform application specific decision making. How Results are used to inform decision making is out-of-scope for this architecture.

<!--
It assesses Attestation Results protections, parses and assesses Attestation Results according to an assessent context (Note: definition of the assessment context is out-of-scope).

The consumer or proxy of Attestation Results. The Role that designates an Entity that requires reliable and believable statements about the Trustworthiness of an Attester Role.
-->

### Role Messages {#messages}

#### Evidence {#evidence}

Claims that are formatted and protected by an Attester.

Evidence SHOULD satisfy Verifier expectations for freshness, identity, context, provenance, validity, relevance and veracity.
<!--
 A Message type created and conveyed by the Attester Role. Attestation Evidence can be consumed and relayed by other Roles, primarily the Verifier Role to appraise the Evidence.
 -->

#### Reference Values

Reference-values are Claims that a manufacturer, vendor or other supply chain entity makes that affects the trustworthiness of an Attester endpoint. Claims may be persistent properties of the endpoint due to the physical nature of how it was manufactured or may reflect the processes that were followed as part of moving the endpoint through a supply-chain; e.g., validation or compliance testing. This class of Reference-values is known as Endorsements. Another class of Reference-values identifies the firmware and software that could be installed in the endpoint after its manufacture. A digest of the the firmware or software can be an effective identifier for keeping track of the images produced by vendors and installed on an endpoint. This class of Reference-value is referred to as Known-Good-Value (KGV).

<!--
NMS What about calling them "Reference Digests"? This is more to the point of what it is.
-->

Known-Good-Values:

: Claims about the Attested Computing Environment. Typically, KGV Claims are message digests of firmware, software or configuration data supplied by various vendors.
If an Attesting Computing Environment implements cryptography, they include Claims about key material.

: Like Claims, Known-Good-Values SHOULD satisfy a Verifier's expectations for freshness, identity, context, provenance, validity, relevance and veracity.
Known-Good-Values are reference Claims that are - like Evidence - well formatted and protected (e.g. signed).
<!--
A Message type created and distributed by the Asserter Role and consumed by the Verifier Role. Known-Good-Values are reference Claims that are used to appraise the believability and veracity of attestation Evidence.
-->

Endorsements:

: Claims about immutable and implicit characteristics of the Attesting Computing Environment. Typically, endorsement Claims are created by manufacturing or supply chain entities.

: Endorsements are intended to increase the level of confidence with respect to Evidence created by an Attester.
<!--
A Message type created and distributed by the Asserter Role and consumed by the Verifier Role. Endorsements provide Claims about Components of an Attester that an Attesting Environment cannot create Evidence about.
-->

#### Results {#results}

Statements about the output of an appraisal of Evidence that are created, formatted and protected by a Verifier.

Attestation Results provide the basis for a Relying Party to establish a level of confidence in the trustworthiness of an Attester.
Attestation Results SHOULD satisfy Relying Party expectations for freshness, identity, context, provenance, validity, relevance and veracity.
<!--
A Message type created by the Verifier Role and ultimately consumed by Relying Parties.
-->

## RATS Principals

RATS Principals are entities, users, organizations, devices and computing environments (e.g., devices, platforms, services, peripherals).

RATS Principals may implement one or more RATS Roles. Role interactions occurring within the same RATS Principal are out-of-scope.

The methods whereby RATS Principals may be identified, discovered, authenticated, connected and trusted, though important, are out-of-scope.

Principal operations that apply resiliency, scaling, load balancing or replication are generally believed to be out-of-scope.

{:rats #Principals title="RATS Principals-Role Composition"}

RATS Principals have the following properties:

* Multiplicity - Multiple instances of RATS Principals that possess the same RATS Roles can exist.
* Composition - RATS Principals possessing different RATS Roles can be combined into a singleton RATS Principal possessing the union of RATS Roles. RATS Interactions between combined RATS Principals is uninteresting.
* Decomposition -  A singleton RATS Principal possessing multiple RATS Roles can be divided into multiple RATS Principals.

RATS Interactions may occur between them.

# Security Considerations

RATS Evidence, Verifiable Assertions and Results SHOULD use formats that support end-to-end integrity protection and MAY support end-to-end confidentiality protection.
Replay attack prevention MAY be supported if a Nonce Claim is included.
Nonce Claims often piggy-back other information and can convey attestation semantics that are of essence to RATS, e.g. the last four bytes of a challenge nonce could be replaced by the IPv4 address-value of the Attester in its response.

All other attacks involving RATS structures are not explicitly addressed by RATS architecture.
Additional security protections MAY be required of conveyance mechanisms.
For example, additional means of authentication, confidentiality, integrity, replay, denial of service and privacy protection of RATS payloads and Principals may be needed.
